Employee Search service library
    <p>This is a java script (micro) library published in <a href='https://www.npmjs.com'>npm</a> (MIT). This will allow to search Employees(stored in a json file) through a simple public API.
    During the process exercised create the javascript library, setup the github repo, publish the module to npm, setup the test suite with code coverage reporting using Karma, Mocha and Chai,
    add continuous integration, add ES6 (ES2015) with Babel, configure webpack, distribute the library as public (Isomorphic Javascript) module (consumable by both the browser and node)</p>

<ul>Dependency libraries (npm i -s / npm install --save)
    <li>mocha chai</li>
    <li>unique-random-array</li>
    <li>semantic-release-cli</li>
    <li>commitizen</li>
    <li>cz-conventional-changelog</li></ul>

To use this library :
<p>npm install search-emplyee,
    then call the public methods all, random</p>
